## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Launch screen.
- [ ] Calculates total bill including tip for each person if the bill is being split with others.

## Notes

Launch screen image was not showing up at first. I added text to the launch screen and the text was being displayed with a white background. This issue was fixed by closing XCode and opening it again.
